# LianJustineCruz_PendulumMotion_FinalProject

This project implements a Pendulum Motion Calculator, a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to compute various characteristics of a pendulum's motion based on user-provided inputs. • Purpose and objectives: The purpose of this project is to create an intuitive tool to calculate and display key pendulum properties, such as period, frequency, maximum velocity, and maximum displacement, using user-friendly GUI components.

Steps on how to use this calculator:
•	Step 1:  Launch the application by running the Java file. 
•	Step 2: Enter the pendulum length (in meters), release angle (in degrees), and gravity (in m/s²).
•	 Step 3: Click the "Calculate" button to display the pendulum motion properties.
•	 Step 4: Click the "Reset" button to clear all inputs and reset the application.
